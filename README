To compile, use the Makefile. 

To run, you can either use the generated executable file, or run it in prolog.
If using the executable file:
   You must specify a debug file for Alma to run, using the following command-line arguments: 
   'debug N Fname'
   N specifies the debugging level, as described below:
     0 - Nothing
     1 - Show step numbers, and at that step: added formulas, deleted formulas, tcp input, tcp output.
     2 - In addition to the above, show the agenda
     3 - In addition, show successful resolutions
   Fname specifies the name of the file in which the debugging information will go.

If running in prolog:
   Start by loading the file toplevel.pl. Following that, execute the following command:
   'initialize.'
   After initialization, provide any desired command-line arguments with the command 'handle_args(X).'
   As with the executable, you must specify a debug file, otherwise Alma will crash on any commands
   given. Follow the instructions above on how to specify a debug file.
